# odin-recipes

My thoughts before starting this project:

This is my very first project based on the The Odin Project tutorial. I am very excited to start building my porfolio. A recipes website is something I would want to create anyway - even if it wasn't part of this tutorial. I like cooking and I like learning new dishes. I will be happy to create this kind of project even if it ends up only for my personal use.
