  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is Zereshk Polo, a distinguished Persian dish.</p>
  <p>The popular Zereshk Polo features many of the elements of Persian cooking. Barberries, which are quite tart and bright in color, are layered within the fluffy Basmati rice and served with succulent chicken, or if you prefer with lamb or beef.</p>
  <p>Zereshk Polo is a delightful dance of sweet and sour; one of the pillars of Persian cooking. Whether you like it sweet or more on the tart side, this dish has something to offer to everyone. The regal barberries are brought to life in the company of butter and sugar, while glistening with a luscious layer of saffron.</p>
